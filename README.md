# screensaver_4

Screensaver needed to be made.
Like the colliding galaxies that I had on x-windows in them olden days.

Build with visual studio and you will see galaxies collidy.

Will probably have bugs.

- build to ```.exe```,
- then rename to ```.scr```,
- then copy to windows/system32 while ignoring all warnings.
- then enable in display settings
